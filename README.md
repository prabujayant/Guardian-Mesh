# Guardian Mesh: Autonomous Cybersecurity for IoT Networks

## 1. Introduction

The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to increased connectivity across industries, enabling automation and efficiency. However, the heterogeneity, resource limitations, and lack of standard security measures in IoT networks make them susceptible to cyber threats such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, unauthorized access, and eavesdropping.

**Guardian Mesh** is an autonomous cybersecurity framework designed to secure IoT networks through real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated threat mitigation. By leveraging real-time packet inspection, intelligent threat isolation, and recovery mechanisms, Guardian Mesh ensures minimal downtime and resource efficiency in heterogeneous IoT environments.

## 2. System Architecture and Design

Guardian Mesh follows a three-tier hierarchical architecture:

### A. Edge Layer
- Serves as the primary interface with IoT devices.
- Uses Docker containers with minimal Debian OS for simulation.
- Implements a custom network (`hackathon_my_network`) with unique MAC address assignment for each node.

### B. Processing Layer
- Implements real-time traffic inspection and anomaly detection.
- Uses Python-based packet analysis for metadata extraction.
- Employs statistical deviation analysis for threat detection.

### C. Management Layer
- Provides administrative control via Flask.
- Maintains logging mechanisms for post-incident analysis and system optimization.
- Ensures continuous authentication and strict access control policies.
